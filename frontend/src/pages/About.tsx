<<<<<<< HEAD
              To nurture logical thinking and analytical reasoning, creating a
              platform where curiosity meets challenge. We believe mathematics is
              about patterns, structure, and ideas—not just numbers.
=======
              To cultivate a strong culture of mathematical thinking and
              problem-solving, empowering students to approach challenges
              logically and creatively.

<<<<<<< HEAD
              Through interactive sessions, thought-provoking problems, competitions,
              and discussions, we encourage students to explore mathematics beyond
              textbooks and develop problem-solving excellence.
=======
              We organize math-based events, logical puzzles, technical
              sessions, quizzes, and collaborative problem-solving activities
              that connect mathematics with real-world applications and
              technology.

              Why ekasutram It helps students understand concepts clearly, see
              mathematics in the world around them, and apply logic in creative
              and competitive ways. Through initiatives like Mathletics,
              Mathematical Moment, and Bhaskar, the club supports academic
              success, encourages creative thinking, and provides hands-on
              problem-solving experiences. Ekasutram creates a space where
              students don’t just learn mathematics they learn how to think
              mathematically.

          <p>
            At Ekasutram, we believe that mathematics is more than numbers and
            formulas— it's a universal language that enables us to understand
            patterns, solve complex problems, and innovate across all fields of
            study. Our mission is to create a vibrant community where students
            can explore mathematical concepts beyond the classroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            We foster an environment of collaborative learning, critical
            thinking, and creativity. Through workshops, competitions, and
            interactive sessions, we help students develop the analytical skills
            needed to excel in academics, research, and their future careers.
